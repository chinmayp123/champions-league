# Futbol Lab

A football match tracker and betting harness for the **Premier League**, **LaLiga** and the
**2026-27 UEFA Champions League**, with MLS next: live scores, real shot-level xG, lineups
on a pitch, a model that prices every market, a paper bet card that grades itself, and a
scorecard that judges the model. It was Starball Lab while it covered only the Champions
League.

**On the web:** [futbol-lab.vercel.app](https://futbol-lab.vercel.app) ·
[chinmayp123.github.io/futbol-lab](https://chinmayp123.github.io/futbol-lab/) — the same
front end as the desktop widget (below), fed by Firestore. Every page has its own address —
`#/today`, `#/league/epl/table`, `#/match/<id>`, `#/bets/record` — so links and the back button
work. Match data is public; the bet record, the day's card and slip tracking need the owner's
Google sign-in.

Zero runtime dependencies — Node 18+ and Electron. ESPN, FotMob, FanDuel and Action Network
are all keyless; two optional keys unlock cross-book line shopping.

> **Built for the 2026 World Cup, repointed in September 2026.** Every competition-specific
> id and format rule lives in `competition.mjs`. Switch back with `"competition": "wc"` in
> `odds.config.json` (or `COMPETITION=wc`). Each competition keeps its own bet log under
> `bets/`, so calibrations never bleed across tournaments.

## Quickstart

```sh
npm install         # first time — pulls Electron
npm run widget      # launch the widget
```

Nothing else is required. Without any API key you still get live scores, xG, lineups,
FanDuel prices, public betting splits, predictions and the card; a key only adds cross-book
best prices.

Other entry points:

```sh
node cli.mjs        # terminal tracker (same data layer)
node morning.mjs    # build + record today's card (what the 10:00 task runs)
npm run dist        # Windows installer into dist/
```

---

## The website

The browser can't run the data layer (the feeds refuse cross-origin calls and the odds keys
would be public), so it runs elsewhere, all on free tiers:

- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`, every 5 minutes) runs
  `publisher/publish.mjs` once per competition: the slate, match views, table and record
  without odds keys, then a rationed keyed step for the 10:00 Pacific card, the builder and
  closing prices. It writes to **Firestore** (project `champions-league-a650f`, one subtree
  per competition, locked down by `firestore.rules`).
- **Vercel** (`api/live/<competition>.mjs`) builds a fresh match view on demand for a game
  that's live or about to be, since GitHub starts cron runs late.
- **`web/build.mjs`** assembles the site from `widget/renderer.js`, `style.css` and
  `index.html`; `web/wc.js` stands in for the Electron bridge. Pages builds it on push;
  Vercel builds it on `vercel deploy --prod`.

The owner signs in with Google, and the account is enrolled once with
`node publisher/add-owner.mjs <uid>` (Bets › Record shows the uid). Full detail in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-website--github-pages--firebase-free-tier--vercel).

## The widget

Three places in a 50px broadcast title bar — **Today**, **Leagues ▾**, **Bets** — which
become a bottom bar on phones. The shell is the "Broadcast" design system — Barlow Condensed
for names, JetBrains Mono for numbers, square corners, a lower third and a crawl — in night
navy.

### Today
The landing page, and a calendar. A day strip marks which leagues play each day; pick a day
and its games are split into one section per league — a header in the league's colour (its
name opens the league, **Table ›** its table), then kit-coloured cards in kickoff order (◀ ▶
jump between days with games). On a **Champions League week** (Monday–Thursday of a week
with UCL games) a banner marks the week, the Champions League's section leads every day,
and the starball watermark comes back.

### Leagues
The Leagues menu lists each league with its live or next game. A league has four tabs, and
the PL / LaLiga / UCL switch in its header keeps the tab you're on — from the Premier League
table, LaLiga opens the LaLiga table.

- **Overview** — the week (latest results, then the next games) beside the top of the table
  (and a domestic league's bottom three).
- **Table** — see [Table](#table) below.
- **Fixtures** — the league's slate by day: all, upcoming, or results newest first.
- **Builder** — see [Builder](#builder) below.

### Match
One game in depth, opened from any card, table row, bracket tie or search. A breadcrumb above
it goes to its league or its day.

- **Lower third** — crests, score, status and the headline numbers (win probability,
  predicted score, live moneyline, xG per side, other live games).
- **Stat strip** — six tiles of the numbers that matter right now.
- **The pitch** — both XIs in formation from FotMob with headshots, shirt numbers, live
  ratings and event badges; every shot plotted where it was taken and sized by xG, goals
  ringed. Hover a player, a corner flag, a goalmouth, a penalty box, the centre spot or the
  bench for a popover of that thing's numbers; click a player to pin them and light up
  their shots. A Lineups / Shots / Both switch controls the layers.
- **Pre-match call** — the model's frozen prediction, shown once the game kicks off and
  ticked as each part is decided.
- **Match sheet** — a minute timeline of goals, cards and subs; a mirrored team comparison
  with form; a players table; a market row (odds with implied chances, public tickets vs
  money, the recommendation); and tiles for keeper saves, corners and conditions. At full
  time the market row settles: closing line with the winner ticked, how the public landed,
  and a Result card.
- Before kickoff the model's read leads and the pitch moves below it, since there are no
  shots to plot yet.

### Builder
A market board for any upcoming game — result axis, goals axis, scorers — with a verdict on
every cell (bet, lean, pass, fade, guarded, with the guard's reason). Click cells to build a
slip; the rail prices it with Model / Book / Edge boxes, EV, half-Kelly and correlation
warnings, and can track it into the bet record.

### Table
The 36-club league phase as one ordered list: a coloured rank gutter, a labelled cut row at
each zone change (top 8 straight to the round of 16, 9–24 to the play-off, 25–36 out),
crest, club, domestic league, played, W-D-L, goal difference, points, the last result and
the next fixture. Once the phase ends it becomes the knockout bracket with two-legged ties
folded to aggregate. A domestic league is the same list with its own zones — Premier League:
top four to the Champions League, fifth to the Europa League, bottom three relegated — and
no bracket.

### Bets
**Tonight's card** — every league's singles as ticket cards with a five-cell number strip
(model %, book %, edge, EV, half-Kelly) and the reasoning, plus the for-fun longshot; when
the card is empty a **Why** panel lists every game and the reason it didn't qualify.

**Record** — all leagues side by side (settled legs, hit rate, profit, ROI, CLV), or one
league in full with two scorecards. The **model** scorecard: every pre-match call frozen
before kickoff and graded at full time — result-right rate, exact scores, over 2.5 and BTTS
calls, 1X2 Brier, plus scorer projections with a calibration check by band. The **bet**
record: leg hit rate, Brier, profit, ROI, bankroll curve, calibration, a shadow-fade check,
and closing-line value per leg.

### Getting around
`◀` / `Esc` / `Alt+←` and the browser's back button walk the same history; a sub-tab, a day
or a filter replaces the page rather than stacking up. `/` focuses search — a club or a
fixture opens that match. `⤢` toggles compact mode (phones start in it): one title-bar row,
the bottom bar, single-column cards; the native caption buttons mean Windows 11 Snap Layouts
works in the desktop app. Refresh is every 30 s on a live match, backing off to 2 minutes at
halftime.

## Configuration

`odds.config.json` sits in the data folder (the repo when run from source, the per-user app
data folder when installed — tray menu → **Open data folder**). It is gitignored; never
commit it.

```jsonc
{
  "competition": "ucl",        // or "wc"
  "oddsApiKey": "…",           // optional: The Odds API (multi-book + props)
  "oddspapiKey": "…",          // optional: OddsPapi (best price across books)
  "oddspapiBooks": "fanduel,bet365",
  "fanduelRegion": "nj"
}
```

Both keys are optional and both free tiers are small (500 and 250 requests a month) and
**shared with another project**, so the app caches aggressively and the morning card never
calls them per game.

## Installers

**Get the app** from the site's title bar (Windows downloads `Futbol-Lab-Setup.exe`
directly) or from the [latest release](https://github.com/chinmayp123/futbol-lab/releases/latest)
(`Futbol-Lab-arm64.dmg` for Apple silicon Macs, `Futbol-Lab-x64.dmg` for Intel). Since v1.2
the desktop app is the website in its own window — every competition, live data, sign-in —
with native window buttons, a tray icon and start-with-Windows. It keeps no bet log or odds
keys of its own.

`npm run dist` builds the Windows installer locally. Pushing a version tag
(`git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0`) makes GitHub build the Windows setup and both
macOS `.dmg` files and attach them to a release.

Neither is code-signed: Windows shows a SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway" the first time,
macOS needs right-click → Open.

## Honest about what this is

The pre-match model is largely a **re-expression of the market's own prices**, so its
"edges" are mostly its own rounding error. Three guards exist to catch that, the card
refuses to bet long shots or games it can't price, and it goes quiet on plenty of
matchdays. Scorer, corner and keeper-saves projections are display-only — small samples,
no closing line to check against.

The card is **paper** until closing-line value says otherwise, and the model scorecard is
being collected as the training set for a proper Dixon–Coles engine. A bookmaker calls the
winner about 55% of the time; if this app ever claims 90%, that's a bug.

Not betting advice. Sportsbook prices are negative expected value on average.

## Data

ESPN's public scoreboard and summary endpoints for the active competition provide scores,
box scores, standings and events. FotMob supplies shot-level xG, lineups, ratings and form
(read from the public pages' embedded data). Action Network supplies FanDuel prices and
public betting splits. FanDuel's public sportsbook API supplies corners, BTTS and player
prices. OddsPapi and The Odds API add cross-book prices when a key is present. All of them
are unofficial and best-effort: any failure degrades a view rather than breaking it. Full
detail in [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md).
